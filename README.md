computer.😧 Can you get out?

## 🌟Highlights

## ℹ️Introduction text

This game is quite simple, you carry stuff from place to place
and try to turn on all the components. There are of course some
obstacles in the way, such as an evil bug NPC, that likes to
empty everyone's inventory. But not all npsc are bad, there
are some good ones that will help you get out. 😁
